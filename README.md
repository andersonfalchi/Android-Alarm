# Alarm

 * Require Android API 23 or upper (Android 6.0.0).
 * This is an Alarm project. Supporting multiple alarm, you can set as many as you want.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* watch this video to set up [java](https://youtu.be/EknEIzswvC0) 

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is used to access to the different versions of the Alarm's source code. Download and 
install the version appropriate for your operating system from [hear](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

 The [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) is necessary to build the app. 
There are different options to install it in your system, depending of the IDE you decide to use.
Check Google documentation about [installation](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html) 
for more details on these options. After installing it, add the full path to the directories 'tools/' 
and 'platform-tools/' from your Android SDK installation into the PATH variable 
of your environment.

Open a terminal and type 'android' to start the Android SDK Manager. To build the Alarm for 
Android app you will need to install at least the next SDK packages:

* Android SDK Tools and Android SDK Platform-tools (already installed); upgrade to their last 
versions is usually a good idea.
* Android SDK Build-Tools 27.0.3.
* Android 6.0 (API 23), SDK Platform; needed to build the Alarm app.


Install any other package you consider interesting, such as emulators, [Genymotion](https://youtu.be/MWZ2rVFOQWw).

For other software dependencies check the details in the section corresponding to your preferred 
IDE or build system.

### Fork and download the Alarm repository

* You will need [git](https://git-scm.com/) to access to the different versions of the Alarm's source code. The source code is hosted
on GitHub and may be read by anybody, without a GitHub account. You will need one if you want to 
contribute to the development of the app with your own code.

The next steps will assume you have a GitHub account and that you will get the code from your own fork.

In a web browser, go to https://github.com/leanh153/Android-Alarm, and click the _Fork_ button near the top right corner.

Clone your forked repository:

``` 
 git clone --recursive https://github.com/YOURGITHUBNAME/Android-Alarm.git
